This is the `0.2.0-beta.2` prerelease. Features and configuration are not fully stable, and later versions may contain breaking changes. Pin the version during testing and read the GitHub Release notes before upgrading.
:::

The theme supports blogs and product documentation. Pages under `content/en/docs/` automatically receive a documentation sidebar, a mobile outline, and previous/next navigation.
