# Getting started with ermaozi

You only need Node.js, pnpm, and a text editor to start using this theme.

<!-- more -->

## Install and run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` builds the static pages and Pagefind index before starting the local preview.

## Configure the site

Open `site.config.mjs` and update the origin, site name, author details, and navigation. Comments and engagement services stay unloaded until configured.

## Add a post

Create a Markdown file under `content/en/blog/category/` with a title, description, permalink, date, and tags. Run `pnpm validate` before publishing.
